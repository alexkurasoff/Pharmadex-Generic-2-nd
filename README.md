# Pharmadex 1.5 Web Archive (WAR)
	Here https://github.com/MSH/Pharmadex you can find the "classic" "official" generic version of Pharmadex software.
	In this repository you can find improved, "unofficial" generic release with the implementation of such additional processes:
		* Amendments of any type
		* Cancellation
		* Renewal
	In addition, this release contains a better implementation of the common CTD approach, because has been created after the official one.
	
** It is the last release of the classic Pharmadex 1.0. **
